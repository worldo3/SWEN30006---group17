Thursday, May 7th. Second Meeting:
- main focus on class, component, and sequence diagrams
	=> Class Diagram (low level detailed diagram)
		+ Location 
		+ Description (Location with speicific date/time for processing queries)
		+ Measurement Class for each measurement (ex. rainfall value, data for predictions, prediction value) 
		+ Application/Weather Controller (GET /weather/...)
			> all the functions for communication with the view
			> probably 5 functions needed, according to GET URLs below
	=> Sequence Diagram (Low level process diagram, interactions and calls)
		+ Background Data retrieval
		+ One for each of the 3 functions in the project specification
	=> Component Diagram (High level component diagram)
		+ Major MVC components and its sub component
		+ interface between each component and their methods
- discussion on classes needed based on the 3 main functions for the application
	=> /weather/locations (display detail of all the locations stored)
	=> /weather/data/:location_id/:date or /:post_code/:date (display data for the specified location)
	=> /weather/prediction/:location_id/:period or /:post_code/:period (weather prediction for the specified location)
- brief discussion over the web view and forms (location_id & post code difference)
** issues : post_code vs location_id. 
- Distributed Work Load:
	=> Jordan: Sequence Diagram
	=> Wittawin: Component Diagram
	=> Vincent: Class Diagram
